My name is Darrell Lokadeva Lim, but you can call me Darrell. I am an Information Systems student at Sampoerna University-University of Arizona Joint Campus. I have a strong interest in data science, particularly on how data is leveraged to help companies in decision-making. [cite: 4] I am very eager to apply my skills in data analysis and programming in real-world projects through internships!

## üöÄ My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1.  **TECH STOCK PRICES ANALYSIS**
    * **Description:** This project involved data cleaning and analysis of daily prices and volumes for ten major technology stocks (AAPL, AMZN, BABA, CRM, FB, GOOG, INTC, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA) sourced from Yahoo Finance. 
    * **Key Findings:**
        * Identified Amazon (AMZN) as having the highest closing price ($3731.41 on July 8th, 2021) based on the most recent data. 
        * Visualized the closing price at the end of each month for the 10 tech stocks. 
        * Determined NVIDIA (NVDA) experienced the greatest percent increase in closing price (29.81% on November 11th, 2016). 
    * **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas (CSV I/O, `to_datetime` conversions, `groupby` aggregations, percentage-change calculations), Matplotlib (Time-series plotting with customized ticks, legends, and annotations). 
    * **üîó Link:** [View Project on DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/ff573cec-0ba1-423e-93b2-c0bf98e3ce3c/edit)

2.  **INTERNATIONAL DEBT ANALYSIS**
    * **Description:** This project focused on using PostgreSQL for data extraction and analysis of a dataset containing 2,300 rows of debt indicators for various countries. 
    * **Key Queries & Findings:**
        * Determined the number of distinct countries present (124). 
        * Identified the country with the highest amount of debt (China). 
        * Found the country with the smallest debt repayment entry (Timor Leste, though the resume lists "highest" twice, context suggests "smallest" for the `MIN(debt)` aggregation).
    * **Technologies Used:** PostgreSQL (SQL).
    * **SQL Aggregations Used:** `COUNT(DISTINCT country_name)`, `SUM(debt) ... GROUP BY country_name ORDER BY SUM(debt) DESC LIMIT 1`, filtering by `indicator_code` and using `MIN(debt)`. 
    * **üîó Link:** [View Project on DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/c7099794-242b-457b-868e-32402b95e894/edit) 

3.  **SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER**
    * **Description:** A group project for the Object-Oriented Programming course, creating a sign language interpreter.
    * **My Role:** Handled the back-end development, specifically how the program reads and trains the dataset to predict sign language from a camera feed. 
    * **Architecture:** Used Java for the GUI interface and Python for the back-end (sign language reader and model training). 
    * **Technologies Used (Back-end):** Python, NumPy (array modifications), TensorFlow (deep-learning frameworks, training, inference, tensor math), Scikit-learn (split and train dataset), Mediapipe (real-time hand landmark detection), OpenCV (camera frame grabbing, image manipulation, displaying live footage and predictions).
